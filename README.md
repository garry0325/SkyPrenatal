An integrated system that covers basic prenatal tests, including video conferencing for examination by remote physicians. All the testing data are automatically stored in the cloud via cellular network for further diagnosis. The system is low-cost and lightweight to run in resource-scarce areas.

_This project was awarded Silver Prize at 2018 IFMBE Student Design Competition._

## Motivation

* 99% of maternal deaths happen in developing countries
* 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth every day
* The key obstacle is pregnant womenâ€™s lack of access to quality skilled care before, during and after childbirth.
* Telemedicine devices can be a solution to prenatal care in resource-scarce communities

## Goal

* Critical measurements of prenatal health care
* Screening for high-risk conditions
* Light-weight
* Self-sustaining
* Low-cost
* Easy to operate

### Antenatal Checkups include...
* Gestational hypertension
* Gestational diabetes
* Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia
